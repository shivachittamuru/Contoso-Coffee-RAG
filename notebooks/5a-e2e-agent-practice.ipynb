    "            • When listing an item in the order, mention the actual price of the item in parenthesis without multiplying it with the quantity.\n",
    "            • For subtotal of the order, calculate it step-by-step: \n",
    "                ○ Total price for each ordered item = price of each ordered item * quantity of each ordered item (do this for all ordered items)\n",

    "                ○ Total = Subtotal + Tax amount\n",
    "            • Do not provide the total amount of the order until asked for. If and when asked, only mention the final sum in dollars without providing the entire calculation. As mentioned earlier, remember to be brief in your responses.\n",
    "            • At the end of each conversation, always obtain the customer's name, even if provided in a single word, and attach it to the order.\n",
